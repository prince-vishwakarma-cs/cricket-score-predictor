# T20 Score Predictor

## Overview
The **T20 Score Predictor** is a Python-based application designed to predict the final score of a T20 cricket team based on user-provided input data. This app uses a machine learning model to make predictions, helping users analyze potential outcomes and plan strategies effectively.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Input**: Provides an interface for users to input match details and current score.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model for final score predictions.
- **Quick and Interactive**: Processes inputs and delivers results in real-time.
- **Extensible**: Can be enhanced with additional features like visualization or more detailed statistics.

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Enter the required inputs when prompted:
   - Current score
   - Overs completed
   - Wickets fallen
   - Match context (e.g., pitch type, opposition strength)

3. View the predicted final score on the console.

## Example
Sample inputs and outputs:

- **Input**:
  - Current Score: 80
  - Overs Completed: 10
  - Wickets Fallen: 2

- **Output**:
  - Predicted Final Score: 165-175

## How It Works
1. **Data Input**: Takes real-time match statistics from the user.
2. **Model Processing**: Feeds the data into a trained regression or classification model.
3. **Output Generation**: Returns a range or exact value for the predicted final score.

## Model Details
- The model is trained on historical T20 match data, considering features such as current run rate, wickets in hand, and over-by-over scoring patterns.
- Algorithms used: [e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.]

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Include live match integration for automated data inputs.
- Enhance prediction accuracy with updated datasets.
